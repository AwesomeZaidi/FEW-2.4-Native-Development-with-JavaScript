# FEW 2.4 Navigation Part 2

A second look at navigation with FlatList and Passing Params. 

## Table View Detail View 

On iOS the TableView is the equivalent of the FlatList in React Native. Tapping a list cell to display a another view with information realted to selected cell is a very common navigation pattern.

The class example will take a secon look at the By Breed app from a previous class. This time we will display a list of breed names in a FlatList, tapping a breed will display information about the breed in a detail screen.
